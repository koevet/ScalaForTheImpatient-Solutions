Scala For The Impatient Solutions
=================================

I'm reading the exceptionally good book ["Scala for the Impatient"](http://www.amazon.com/Scala-Impatient-Cay-S-Horstmann/dp/0321774094).
Each chapter of the book ends with some exercises to test out the topics the reader just learned.

Here is my attempt to solve the exercises and hopefully learn something new about the Scala language.

The solutions are organized as [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/) tests.

Use SBT to run the test classes:

``sbt test``

Enjoy!
